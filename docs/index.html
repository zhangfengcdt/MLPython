<h2>Here's a Picture of a Wolf</h2>
<p>Thanks to Flickr user <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/kachnch/16364273038" target="_blank">Katerina Hlavata</a>.</p>
<img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8633/16364273038_eb1b3f122e_k.jpg" width="500" alt="A gorgeous image of a Eurasian wolf">
<p>I couldn't find a good quote about wolves, so here's one that just sounds pretty cool: <blockquote>If you live among wolves, you have to act like a wolf. â€”Nikita Khruschev</blockquote></p>
<p>Like I said, not <em>exactly</em> what I was looking for. But it works for a blockquote.</p>
